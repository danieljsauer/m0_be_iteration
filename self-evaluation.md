# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?

    Each is a great way to run the same code for a group of variables. This can let you set up a code to pick out certain variables within an array or create any sort of criteria you can think of. 

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?

    I need to improve my vocabulary so that I can use all of the proper terms when discussing code and the steps I am taking. I also have to make it a priority to keep adding new methods to my repitoire. I also need to pay particular attention to ruby formatting. 

- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?

    I like how I think about the variable being stored inside of the ||. I think of it as a temporary variable that is being assigned to each index position. 
    
    This made it easy to understand how the array and if statement worked together inside of the each method iteration process.
